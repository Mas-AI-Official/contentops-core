1) VIDEO SCRIPT (paste in "Video Script")
Today we tested a fully local content pipeline on a single machine. The system found trends, generated a script, created voice-over, built subtitles, assembled scenes, and produced a publish-ready vertical video. No cloud lock-in, no random hand-offs, and no mystery failures. We set niche rules, account mappings, and review gates so finance content stays in finance channels, and health content never leaks into unrelated pages. Then we flipped auto mode on. The pipeline started pulling trend signals from YouTube, Reddit, Google News, and niche RSS feeds, then queued jobs with cooldown protection. If publish rules pass, it publishes. If not, it lands in review. That is the core value: automated speed with controlled governance. Content OPS Core is now wired for signal intake, generation, rendering, review, and publishing in one connected loop.
